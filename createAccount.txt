Hello!

-> The extension for my "console program" will be another function like creatAccount(driver: webdriver, email: str, password: str)

1. 
Access the main page https://app.pandascore.co/login
    find the create account link/button, go to that page

2. 
Fill the data and find the reCaptcha checkbox,
    and yes the reCaptcha will be in iframe with selenium you can switch to frame
    if it's reCaptcha with photos there it's a lite bit harder, 
    you need to download the audio instead to select the correct photos.
    After converting audio to text(the words from that .mp3) 
    "your script" will enter the words and check verify(sometimes you need to fill one more checkbox reCaptcha).
